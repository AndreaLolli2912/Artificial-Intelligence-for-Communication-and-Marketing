# Artificial Intelligence for Communication and Marketing

This repository contains three projects completed for the final exam of Artificial Intelligence for Communication and Marketing. The projects focus on customer segmentation, churn prediction, and market basket analysis to enhance marketing strategies and customer retention.

## Project 1: Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

This project utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to enhance marketing efficiency, increase customer retention, and drive business growth by tailoring marketing strategies to high-value customers.

## Project 2: Churn Prediction: A Proactive Approach

This project develops a churn prediction model to identify customers at risk of leaving. By analyzing key drivers of churn, the model provides insights for targeted interventions to improve customer retention and support data-driven decision-making.

## Project 3: Market Basket Analysis for Retailer

This project applies association rules to transaction data to uncover patterns and relationships among items purchased together. The aim is to provide insights for improving customer engagement and experience by suggesting itemsets that customers are likely to purchase together.
